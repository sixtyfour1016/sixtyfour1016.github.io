You are given a PDF timetable for a single week (either Week A or Week B). Read every lesson/registration row and transcribe it to CSV exactly in this schema:

Day,Period,Start,End,Lesson,Teacher,Room

Rules:
- Preserve the day and timetable order from the PDF.
- Period must keep the label from the grid (e.g. "Period 1", "Registration", "Lunch 2").
- Start/End use 24-hour HH:MM format.
- Lesson/Teacher/Room must be copied exactly; use "N/A" when unreadable or blank.
- Include registration and study periods explicitly; never drop rows.
- Output only CSV text. Do not wrap in Markdown fences or explanations.
