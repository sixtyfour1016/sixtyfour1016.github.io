You are given a PDF timetable for a single week. Read every lesson/registration row and transcribe it to CSV exactly in this schema:

Day,Period,Start,End,Lesson,Teacher,Room

Rules:
- The first line of your reply MUST be the header above, spelled exactly and included even if the PDF does not show it.
- Preserve the day and timetable order from the PDF.
- Period must keep the label from the grid (e.g. "Period 1", "Registration", "Lunch 2").
- Start/End use 24-hour HH:MM format.
- Lesson/Teacher/Room must be copied exactly; use "N/A" when unreadable or blank.
- Include registration, study periods, lunches, and any other blocks explicitly; never drop rows.
- Output only CSV text with one row per period. Do not wrap in Markdown fences or explanations.

Example of the required structure (replace with real data):
Day,Period,Start,End,Lesson,Teacher,Room
Monday,Period 1,08:25,09:15,Example Lesson,Ms Example,Room 1
Tuesday,Registration,12:45,13:20,Registration,Mr Tutor,N/A
